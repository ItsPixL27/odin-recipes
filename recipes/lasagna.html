    <img src="url(https://casuallypeckish.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lasagna-1-500x375.jpg)">

    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that's as comforting as it is delicious. It's typically made by layering flat pasta sheets with rich and flavorful sauces and cheeses, then baking it until it's bubbling and golden brown. The pasta layers are often alternated with ingredients like hearty Bolognese sauce (mad>e with ground meat, tomatoes, and sometimes wine), creamy béchamel sauce, and plenty of melted cheese, such as mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta. The result is a hearty, satisfying dish that's perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying as leftovers. Lasagna can be customized in countless ways, with variations including vegetarian, seafood, or even dessert versions featuring sweet ingredients like chocolate and berries.</p>
