    <ul>
        <li>Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>Mixed Vegetables (such as carrots, peas, bell peppers, and potatoes), diced</li>
        <li>Onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Ginger-Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>Whole Spices (such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves)</li>
        <li>Ground Spices (such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee (clarified butter) for cooking</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pan or pressure cooker over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the whole spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves) and sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the thinly sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the mixed vegetables to the pan and sauté for a few minutes until they are slightly tender.</li>
        <li>Season with ground spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala) and salt. Mix well to coat the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked and drained basmati rice to the pan. Stir gently to combine with the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Pour in water (use a 1:2 ratio of rice to water) and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with chopped cilantro leaves before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve hot as a delicious and aromatic main course or side dish.</li>
